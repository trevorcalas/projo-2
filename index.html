<h1>
Public Schools
</h1>
<p>
The truth is, is that public schools are outdated. The same prison-like system has been resued for over 100 years.
The fact of the matter is that kids as a whole learn differently and it varies on each kid, and the current public
school system only caters to some. 91% of kids in the US attend public school, and I can guarantee you that the way they
teach does not even cater to the majority.
